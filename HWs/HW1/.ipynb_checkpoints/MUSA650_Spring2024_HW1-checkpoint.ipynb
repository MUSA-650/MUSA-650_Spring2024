    "\n",
    "1. On this and future homeworks, depending on the data size and your hardware configuration, experiments may take too long if you use the complete dataset. This may be challenging, as you may need to run multiple experiments. So, if an experiment takes too much time, start first with a smaller sample that will allow you to run your code within a reasonable time. Once you complete all tasks, before the final submission, you can allow longer run times and run your code with the complete set. However, if this is still taking too much time or causing your computer to freeze, it will be OK to submit experiments using a sample size that is feasible for your setting (indicate it clearly in your submission). Grading of the homework will not be affected from this type of variations in the design of your experiments.\n",

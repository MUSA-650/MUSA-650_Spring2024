# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week5: Cross-validation, bias variance threadoff, model complexity, evaluation

[Cross-validation: evaluating estimator performance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)

This repository contains:

- [Bias and variance](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2)
- [Model complexity, a regression example](Prac1_ModelComplexity.ipynb)
- [Classifier Comparison](Prac2_ClassifierComparison_v1.ipynb)
- Feature Reduction (Prac3_PCAFaces.ipynb)


### Access to colab for running notebooks:

- Copy shared datasets in a google drive folder
- Go to Google Colab, copy the Jupyter notebook there, or access directly from GitHub (or copy it in your Google Drive, click on it and select "open in Colab")
- Run the notebook (!!! you may need to edit the path to data)

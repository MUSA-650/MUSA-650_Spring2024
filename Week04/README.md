# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week4: 

### Morning Session (hands-on):

- [Brain age prediction challenge](BrainAgePrediction_TrainData.zip)
  Download the zip file and start the jupyter-lab notebook for the task description

- [Notebook for the brain age prediction task](week4_practice_brainage.ipynb)

### New Topics: Supervised learning, bias variance threadoff, model complexity, PCA

This repository contains:

- [A visual intro to supervised learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1)
- [Bias and variance](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2)
- [Model complexity, a regression example](Prac1_ModelComplexity.ipynb)
- [Classifier Comparison](Prac2_ClassifierComparison_v1.ipynb)
- Feature Reduction (Prac3_PCAFaces.ipynb)


### Access to colab for running notebooks:

- Copy shared datasets in a google drive folder
- Go to Google Colab, copy the Jupyter notebook there, or access directly from GitHub (or copy it in your Google Drive, click on it and select "open in Colab")
- Run the notebook (!!! you may need to edit the path to data)
